# Base fields [ecs-base]

The `base` field set contains all fields which are at the root of the events. These fields are common across all types of events.

## Base field details [_base_field_details]

| Field | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $$$field-timestamp$$$[@timestamp](#field-timestamp) |
Date/time when the event originated.<br>This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.<br>If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.<br>Required field for all events.type: date<br><br>
example: `2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z`<br>image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat[relation,title=otlp,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+time_unix_nano+%22&type=code[time_unix_nano]image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat[relation,title=otlp,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+observed_time_unix_nano+%22&type=code[observed_time_unix_nano]image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat[relation,title=otlp,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+start_time_unix_nano+%22&type=code[start_time_unix_nano]**Note:** On logs, events and metrics, `time_unix_nano` defines the time of the event. For logs, `observed_time_unix_nano` defines the time when the event was observed by the collection system. On spans, `start_time_unix_nano` represents the start time of the span.

| $$$field-labels$$$[labels](#field-labels) |
Custom key/value pairs.<br>Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword.<br>Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.type: object<br><br>
example: `{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}`<br>image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/related-efc20d?style=flat[relation,title=related,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/k8s/#k8s-pod-label[k8s.pod.label]image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/related-efc20d?style=flat[relation,title=related,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/container/#container-label[container.label] | core |
| $$$field-message$$$[message](#field-message) |
For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.<br>For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.<br>If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.type: match_only_text<br><br>
example: `Hello World`<br>image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry-4a5ca6?style=flat&logo=opentelemetry[OTel Badge] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/OTLP-ffdcb2?style=flat[relation,title=otlp,link=ecs-opentelemetry.html#ecs-opentelemetry-relation] https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopen-telemetry%2Fopentelemetry-proto+%22\+body+%22&type=code[body]**Note:** The `body` in OTLP is of type `Any` and can be either an unstructured log message or a structured event. | core |
| $$$field-tags$$$[tags](#field-tags) |
List of keywords used to tag each event.type: keyword<br><br>
Note: This field should contain an array of values.<br>
example: `["production", "env2"]`<br> | core |
